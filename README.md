## FAQ

### Why does it show Kudo All rather than the text in my language?

Now, there are 3 languages supported, Chinese, English and French. The language is determined by the locale of your browser rather than that in your webpage.

## Build

```bash
make build.chrome
make build.firefox
```

## Notice

An interesting notice. Artefact is not a typo from the previous author.

> Artefact is the British spelling of the noun meaning, primarily, an object shaped by human workmanship, especially one of historical or archaeological interest. Artifact is the American spelling. Both spellings are etymologically justifiable, and both are hundreds of years old in English. The British preference for artefact is a new development.
